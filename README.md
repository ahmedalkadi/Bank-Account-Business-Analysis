Bank Accounts Analysis for Unsupervised Machine Learning Project Overview

This project aims to perform an analysis of bank account data using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The primary objectives include evaluating different data transformation techniques, comparing the performance of principal component analysis (PCA) with kernel PCA, exploring various evaluation metrics, and testing multiple unsupervised algorithms for clustering and anomaly detection.


Analysis Goals:

Data Transformation Techniques: Evaluate the effectiveness of different data transformation techniques such as normalization, standardization, scaling and identify outliers in the dataset.

PCA vs. Kernel PCA: Compare the performance of PCA and kernel PCA in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its variance.

Evaluation Metrics: Explore various evaluation metrics like the silhouette score, Gap statistics, and Investiage the optimum cluster numbers.

Unsupervised Algorithms: Implement and compare multiple unsupervised learning algorithms, including K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, Gaussian mixture models (EM), and DBSCAN.

T-SNE Visualization: Use T-SNE to visualize the high-dimensional data in 2D  and observe how the results differ based on the choices made throughout the analysis.

Cluster the bank clients according to their accounting behavior to different business groups
